/**
 * An object that can assemble structured header representations into their MIME
 * representation.
 *
 * The character-counting portion of this class operates using individual JS
 * characters as its representation of logical character, which is not the same
 * as the number of octets used as UTF-8. If non-ASCII characters are to be
 * included in headers without some form of encoding, then care should be taken
 * to set the maximum line length to account for the mismatch between character
 * counts and octet counts: the maximum line is 998 octets, which could be as
 * few as 332 JS characters (non-BMP characters, although they take up 4 octets
 * in UTF-8, count as 2 in JS strings).
 *
 * This code takes care to only insert line breaks at the higher-level breaking
 * points in a header (as recommended by RFC 5322), but it may need to resort to
 * including them more aggressively if this is not possible. If even aggressive
 * line-breaking cannot allow a header to be emitted without violating line
 * length restrictions, the methods will throw an exception to indicate this
 * situation.
 *
 * In general, this code does not attempt to modify its input; for example, it
 * does not attempt to change the case of any input characters, apply any
 * Unicode normalization algorithms, or convert email addresses to ACE where
 * applicable. The biggest exception to this rule is that most whitespace is
 * collapsed to a single space, even in unstructured headers, while most leading
 * and trailing whitespace is trimmed from inputs.
 *
 * @param {StreamHandler} handler The handler to which all output is sent.
 *   @param {Function(String)} handler.deliverData Receives encoded data.

 *   @param [options.softMargin=78] {30 <= Integer <= 900}

 *     The maximum number of logical characters that can be included in a line,

///////////////////////
// Low-level methods //
///////////////////////

// Explanation of the emitter internals:
// RFC 5322 requires that we wrap our lines, ideally at 78 characters and at
// least by 998 octets. We can't wrap in arbitrary places, but wherever CFWS is
// valid... and ideally wherever clients are likely to expect it. In theory, we
// can break between every token (this is how RFC 822 operates), but, in RFC
// 5322, many of those breaks are relegated to obsolete productions, mostly
// because it is common to not properly handle breaks in those locations.
//
// So how do we do line breaking? The algorithm we implement is greedy, to
// simplify implementation. There are two margins: the soft margin, which we
// want to keep within, and the hard margin, which we absolutely have to keep
// within. There are also two kinds of break points: preferred and emergency.
// As long as we keep the line within the hard margin, we will only break at
// preferred breakpoints; emergency breakpoints are only used if we would
// otherwise exceed the hard margin.
//
// For illustration, here is an example header and where these break points are
// located:
//
//            To: John "The Rock" Smith <jsmith@a.long.domain.invalid>
// Preferred:         ^          ^     ^
// Emergency:         ^    ^     ^     ^^      ^ ^    ^      ^       ^
//
// Preferred breakpoints are indicated by setting the mayBreakAfter parameter of
// addText to true, while emergency breakpoints are set after every token passed
// into addText. This is handled implicitly by only adding text to _currentLine
// if it ends in an emergency breakpoint.
//
// Internally, the code keeps track of margins by use of two variables. The
// _softMargin and _hardMargin variables encode the positions at which code must
// absolutely break, and are set up from the initial options parameter. Breaking
// happens when _currentLine.length approaches these values, as mentioned above.

/**
 * Send a header line consisting of the first N characters to the handler.
 *
 * If the count parameter is missing, then we presume that the current header
 * value being emitted is done and therefore we should not send a continuation
 * space. Otherwise, we presume that we're still working, so we will send the
